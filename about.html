    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>			
<strong>hey there âœ¨</strong><br>
	My name is Isabel Lah. 
	I major in music and minor in media. Fall 2018 will be my last semester here at Hunter, and I can't believe it. I play some classical, but I prefer playing chords. I hope one day I can create good music and videos. I love taking pictures and videos of things that capture me, using my camera or phone. Through multimedia, I believe that I can share a story. <br>
	Some of my favorite things: music with good melody & lyrics, animation movies, cute illustrations, furry animals, Korean food, sunsets/sunrises, flowers, stationary.</p>
